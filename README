About words:
==========
Words is a simple little program that uses user input to play a game, change settings, view who has used the program etc... There isn't much there right now, but we are thinking of some features and adding them as soon as we can

The default password for the settings is 'password' if you want to change it you can do that in the settings if you want.

How to install:
============== 
see INSTALL file
