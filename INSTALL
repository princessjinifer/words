How to install the binary :
---------------------------
installing the binary doens't work at the moment
wait for a future release to fix that :)

execute with the commands:
cd bin/
./words

NOTE: changing the directory is important, ./bin/words will break some of the features.

How to install binary from source:
---------------------------------
Under GNU/Linux, compile it:
./compile.sh

copying the files doesn't work right now
wait for a future release for that feature...

execute it with:
cd bin/ 
NOTE: make sure you are in the same directory as the compile script before doing this
./words
