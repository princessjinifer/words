How to install the binary :
---------------------------
installing the binary doens't work at the moment
wait for the next release to fix that :)

execute with the commands:
cd words-0.2/bin/32-bit // changing the directory is improtant, ./words-0.2/bin/32-bit/words will break some of the features.
./words

How to install binary from source:
---------------------------------
Under GNU/Linux, compile it:
make

copying the files doesn't work right now
wait for the next release to be able to do that...

execute it with:
cd src/copy // make sure you are in the directory with the Makefile before doing this
./words
